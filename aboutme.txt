INTRODUCTION
I'm a 3D & graphic artist who loves video games, movies, and steak. I'm an Army veteran who went to school for Game Art & Design. I currently work in retail and do some freelance graphic design.

It's taken me most of my adult life to discover what's most important to me. Financial freedom is something I've been striving towards the last 7 or 8 years of my life. My journey has been long, but I'm hopeful for the future.

WHERE I'M FROM
I was born and raised in Houston, Texas but I've lived all over the southern U.S. I spent some time in El Paso, Phoenix, Columbus, Augusta, Atlanta, and even lived in Japan for a couple years. I'm currently staying in Crosby, Texas.
