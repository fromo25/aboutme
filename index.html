  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a web developer and graphic artist who loves video games, movies, and steak. I'm an Army veteran who went to school for <b style="color: #99ccff">Game Art and Design.</b> I currently work in retail and do some freelance graphic design.</p>
  <p>It's taken me most of my adult life to discover what's most important to me. Financial freedom is something I've been striving towards the last 7 or 8 years of my life. My journey has been long, but I'm hopeful for the future.</p>
  <p>Movies are also important to me. The older I get, the more I appreciate a great film. There's nothing like sitting down, relaxing, and being captivated by a well crafted cinematic adventure.</p>

  <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
  <p>At one point my dream job was to become an environment artist at a triple A game developer, but I don't see myself enjoying that as much as I thought I would, knowing what I know now about the game industry. So, at this point I think my dream job would be a very, very successful freelance graphic artist.</p>
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>Some music I've been listening to lately are <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tokyo+Police+Club" class="music-links">Tokyo Police Club</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Street+Sweeper+Social+Club">Street Sweeper Social Club.</a></p>
